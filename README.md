A Jokes Generator 😂 is a web-based application designed to fetch and display random jokes in an interactive way. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the generator uses API integration 🌐 to retrieve jokes from an external source, ensuring fresh and varied content each time. The user interface typically includes a button 🎯 to generate new jokes, and with each click, the app fetches a new joke from the API, updates the DOM, and presents the joke to the user instantly. This project demonstrates core web development skills 💻, including asynchronous programming, API handling, and DOM manipulation. It's perfect for practicing frontend technologies while adding a fun twist with humor! 🎉
